/**
 @name BlockDefinition
 @sbol Component
 @description A component of a construct, or construct itself.

 Blocks are hierarchically composable elements which make up large constructs of DNA. Hierarchy is established with the `components` field, whereby a block references its children.

 Blocks may have a `sequence`, which is a reference to a file and associated annotations, and if so should reference their source (e.g. foundry, NCBI) whence they came.

 Blocks can define `rules`, to which constitutive blocks must adhere. For example, bounds to GC content, or template grammar (e.g. position 0 must be a promoter). The type is the key, the rule is the value (heterogeneous formats)

 List Blocks allow for combinatorial logic, where multiple blocks can be associated as combinatorial `options` for this block.

 In addition to sequence annotations, a block may list `notes`, which are essentially annotations that do not specifically reference the sequence.
